# ASL Gemini App

Welcome to the ASL Gemini App repository! This project is designed to help users learn American Sign Language (ASL) through interactive gameplay and AI-powered feedback. 

## Overview

The ASL Gemini App utilizes AI technology to teach users ASL vocabulary and assess their signing accuracy. Users are presented with ASL words or phrases and are prompted to sign them using the camera on their device. The app then compares the user's signed language to the expected word or phrase, providing feedback and guidance based on Gemini's advice.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users engage in interactive gameplay where they sign ASL words or phrases prompted by the app.
- **AI-Powered Feedback**: The app utilizes AI technology to analyze the user's signed language and provide feedback on correctness and areas for improvement.
- **Gemini Advice**: Feedback and advice provided to users are based on Gemini's insights, helping users understand where they went wrong and how to improve.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can track their progress in learning ASL vocabulary and monitor their improvement over time.
